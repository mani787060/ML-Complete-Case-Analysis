# Complete Case Analysis in Machine Learning

-> This project demonstrates the **Complete Case Analysis (CCA)** technique for handling missing values in a dataset.  
-> In this approach, we remove rows (or sometimes columns) that contain any missing data, ensuring the analysis is performed only on complete cases.

## Topics Covered:-
-> Understanding missing data  
-> Identifying missing values using pandas  
-> Applying complete case analysis  
-> Comparing dataset shape before and after removal  
-> Observing the effect on model training  

## Libraries Used:-
-> pandas  
-> numpy  
-> scikit-learn  

## Key Takeaway:-
Complete Case Analysis is:
-> **Simple and quick**, but may reduce dataset size  
-> Useful when the proportion of missing data is **small**  
-> Important as a baseline before applying more advanced imputation methods  

 **Note:**  
-> The notebook uses a sample dataset with intentional missing values to demonstrate how complete case analysis works and what trade-offs it introduces.
